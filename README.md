# UnityScripts

Welcome to the UnityScripts repository! This is a collection of Unity scripts that I've created, which I believe will be useful to others in the Unity development community. I'll be periodically adding new scripts to this repository, each within its own folder complete with a dedicated README explaining the script and its features.

## Getting Started

To use the scripts in your Unity projects, follow these steps:

1. **Clone or download this repository.** You can do this by running `git clone https://github.com/DakotaCondos/UnityScripts.git` in your terminal or command prompt, or by downloading the ZIP file directly from GitHub.

2. **Import the scripts into your Unity project.** Open your Unity project, navigate to the Assets menu, and choose Import Package > Custom Package. Select the script files you wish to use.

3. **Attach the scripts to your GameObjects.** In the Unity editor, select the GameObject you want to apply the script to, then drag the script file from your Assets onto the Inspector window.

## Scripts Overview

Below is a list of the available scripts. Each script is organized into its own folder, where you will find a dedicated README with detailed information on features, usage, and any other relevant details.

### [TextMeshProFormatter](/TextMeshProFormatter)

A versatile formatter for building rich text strings for TextMeshPro, supporting a wide range of formatting options such as bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, color, size, and more.

For detailed information about each script, including features and usage examples, please refer to the README in the respective script folder.
